# EDA_Project

The EDA project is an attempt to study the data received on an online course conducted by Newcastle University. The data spreads over a period of 7 years from 2011 â€“ 2017. 

## Requirements 

The project is made using R as platform with ProjectTemplate and Rmarkdown methods. 

The project has various files and main files are in the report folder. 

There are 4 Rmarkdown reports that can be opened in R studio.  They are EDA_Project, EDA_project2, EDA_project3 and EDA_Project4. 

## What if you do not have R studio

If you do not have R studio in your system, the results of these reports are also available as Microsoft Word document format with same name.

Also, a presentation is available about the whole project.

## Where to find the data

The data used for this project is available in the data folder. Though there were many files available for the analysis, I have made use only a few and all they are available in the same folder. 


# How to run the code
To run the code, one must have R studio with ProjectTemplate, Rmarkdown and other require packages in their system. These libraries will be called in the initial steps of the program. 
Open reports folder and run the Rmarkdown files. 

The munge folder contain a file 01-A.R and it contain the settings for the working directory.  It must be modified and set the location details so that R can find where to search for the files related to the project.
